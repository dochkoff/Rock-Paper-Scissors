## Overview
Guess A Number is a simple two player game where you and your opponent (the computer) choose one of the three options: **"rock"**, **"paper"** and **"scissors"**. The roles are as follows:

- **Rock beats scissors** (the scissors get broken by the rock)
- **Scissors beats papaer** (paper get cut by the scissors)
- **Paper beats rock** (the paper covers the rock)

The **winner** is whose choice beats the choice of his opponent. If both players choose the same options (e.g. "rock"), the game outcome is "drow".

After each game you will be asked if you want to play again. If the answer is "yes", a new game starts, if not, the final result is displayed.
Good luck!
